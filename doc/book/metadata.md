abstract: Neural Turing Machine for a Processing Unit verified with UVM/OSVVM/FV. A Processing Unit (PU) is an electronic system within a computer that carries out instructions of a program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and I/O operations specified by instructions. Instruction-level parallelism is a measure of how many instructions in a computer can be executed simultaneously. The PU is contained on a single Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) Integrated Circuit (IC). A Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is a recurrent neural network model. NTMs combine the fuzzy pattern matching capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic power of programmable computers. A NTM has a neural network controller coupled to external memory resources, which it interacts with through attentional mechanisms. The memory interactions are differentiable end-to-end, making it possible to optimize them using gradient descent.
